What on Earth is Git?
----------------------
If you need help getting started with Git, we can recommend a few useful resources:

 - The Git home page
   - `http://git-scm.org`
   - The home of Git itself! Also provides lots of links to other resources

 - The GitHub help pages
   - `http://help.github.com/`
   - These provide quite a lot of useful general Git information

 - An Introduction to Git (video 1h22)
   - `http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR433b0HJY`
   - A presentation by Scott Chacon, this is an excellent primer and well
    worth taking an hour out to sit down and watch. Highly recommended.

What on Earth is Git?
----------------------
If you need help getting started with Git, we can recommend a few useful resources:

 * The Git home page
   ** http://git-scm.org
   ** The home of Git itself! Also provides lots of links to other resources

 * The GitHub help pages
   ** http://help.github.com/
   ** These provide quite a lot of useful general Git information

 * An Introduction to Git (video 1h22)
   ** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR433b0HJY
   ** A presentation by Scott Chacon, this is an excellent primer and well
      worth taking an hour out to sit down and watch. Highly recommended.

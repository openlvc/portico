# Many JVMs use special signal traps to do innocuous things. GDB will get these and possibly
# interpret them incorrectly. For example, the code "if( "".equals(null) )" is valid, and a
# JVM will catch a SIGSEGV and throw a NullPointerException. GDB however gets in there early
# and signals an error when this happens.
# 
# To avoid this, we add some special GDB instructions for various signals to ensure they are
# don't cause to much pain from false positives.

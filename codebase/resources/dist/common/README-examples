Portico Example Federates
============================================
  Portico ships with a simple example federate that has been implemented in each of the major
  HLA API versions, and for both Java and C++. 

  In this document we'll tell you a bit about how to compile and run the examples, as well as
  explaining how the federates work internally so that you can use the code as a guide to the
  basics of writing a federate.

1. Finding the Examples
------------------------
  Portico ships with Java and C++ example federates for both the HLA 1.3 and IEEE-1516e interfaces.
  These are provided as source code which must be compiled before you can use them.

  To make sure this process is smooth, scripts are provided to do the compiling. These scripts
  can also show you what variables you need to set up in your environment to get Portico operating
  correctly.

  - Java HLA 1.3:   `RTI_HOME/examples/java/hla13`
  - Java IEE-1516e: `RTI_HOME/examples/java/ieee1516e`
  - C++ HLA 1.3     `RTI_HOME/examples/cpp/hla13`
  - C++ IEE-1516e:  `RTI_HOME/examples/cpp/ieee1516e`


2. The Example Federate
------------------------
  The example federate is designed to demonstrate how to:

  1. Publish and Subscribe
  2. Register and delete an object
  3. Update attribute values
  4. Send an interaction
  5. Advance time
  6. Use synchronization points

  The federate is time constrained and regulating. It has a simple basic lifecycle: Setup,
  Main Loop, Tear Down. You should look through the code if you want a better insight into
  what it is doing and how you can do the same. We'll talk about its high-level lifecycle
  here.

  During the **setup phase** it will create a single object that it will update later while also
  taking care of publication/subscription and enabling its time policy.

  Coordination among the federates is handled by synchronization points. Once setup it complete
  it prompt the user to hit Enter. When they do it will achieve the sync point `ReadyToRun` and
  wait for others to do so.

  During the **main loop** phase the federate will advance time from 1-20 in 1.0 increments.
  At each step it will sent an attribute update for the object that it registered and will also
  send a single interaction before requesting a time advancement.

  Each received reflection/interaction has its details printed to the screen, allowing you to
  see the information that is being received from other federates. If you run two instances of
  the test federate you will be able to see this information coming in.

  During the **tear down** phase, the federate will cease its activities, resign from the
  federation and then attempt to destroy it (the last one out will be successful).

  The standard demonstration for this example federate consists of running two instances of
  it concurrently so that you can see the information being exchanged.


3. Compiling
-------------
  Each federate ships as source code, so you have to compile it for your platform.
  Helper scripts are provided to make this process as simple as possible.

  Each example federate has helper scripts/batch files to aid in building and running the
  federate. The scripts are either `linux64.sh` or `win64-vc10.bat`. The arguments they take
  are identical for both (linux used in these examples):

  - `./linux.sh clean`    => Remove all the code/jars that were created
  - `./linux.sh compile`  => Compile the code for the federate
  - `./linux.sh execute`  => Run the federate

  **NOTE** If you want to compile the Java federates, you'll need to have a full JDK installed.
           The JRE that ships with Portico is only sufficient for running existing federates.

  **NOTE** If you want to build the C++ example federates, you will need to have a supported
           compiler installed and have your environment set up for it.
           On windows we suggest you execute these commands from the Visual Studio Command Prompt
           (remember to pick the right one for 32 or 64-bit).


### Windows C++ Example
  ```
  -- Open Visual Studio Command Prompt --
  $ cd %RTI_HOME\examples\cpp\ieee1516e
  $ win64-vc10 compile
  $ win64-vc10 execute
  ```

### Linux C++ Example
  ```
  $ cd $RTI_HOME/examples/cpp/ieee1516e
  $ ./linux64.sh compile
  $ ./linux64.sh execute federateTwo
  ```

### Mac OS X C++ Example
  ```
  $ cd $RTI_HOME/examples/cpp/ieee1516e
  $ ./macos.sh compile
  $ ./macos.sh execute federateTwo
  ```

### Debugging C++ Federates
  If you get a crash or just want to step through the C++ federates you can do so. They are
  compiled against the debug libraries by default.

  For Windows federates, you should use the Visual Studio debugging tools. They are well equipped
  for this. Take a look at the batch files to see what compiler options and symbols are set so
  that you can then set up your project correctly.

  For Linux / Mac OS X, a GDB env file is provided. This means you can fire up GDB and get debugging
  like it's 1985!

  ```
   Linux: gdb -x gdb-linux.env ./example-federate
  Mac OS: sudo ggdb -x gdb-macos.env ./example-federate
  ```


4. Running
-----------
  After you have compiled the federate you can execute it using the helper scripts. You do this
  by passing the `execute` argument to the script. If you want to give the federate a specific
  name you can pass an additional argument for it to use. This will allow you to run multiple
  example federates together without a name clash.

  ```
  examples:
  $ ./linux64.sh execute               // runs with the federate name "exampleFederate"
  $ ./linux64.sh execute federateTwo   // runs with the federate name "federateTwo"
  ```

  To avoid startup problems we recommend you start a single federate first, and proceed to start
  the other federates once the first is prompting you to hit enter.

  When all federates are started, hit enter on each and they will commence running. You will
  see output something like the following:

  ```
  RTI_HOME environment variable is set to /opt/portico-2.1.0
